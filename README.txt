Hello grader,

Here's how to run my website:
  -first open project in your IDE (preferably PyCharm) and install the correct packages/libraries
  -then, run main.py that is the driver for the Flask app. This should start a web server on your local computer.
  -you should see a populated table of users.
    -you can add new users by clicking the 'Add User' button and filling out the form
    -you can search for current users by clicking the search button. the search instructions were vague in the doc, so this site searches by name and returns users with mathcing substrings
    -you can remove users by pressing the red 'Remove' button 
    -you can edit existing users by pressing the 'Edit' link and filling out the form

so, yeah, everything should work fine because it does. if you have issues email me at aboyd3@umbc.edu. I look forward to my A.

-AJ
